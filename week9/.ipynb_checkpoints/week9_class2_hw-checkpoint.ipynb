       " \"Meh.Cute space, but small. Portions are the right size but the food is expensive. Didn't enjoy my dish, Spaghetti e Cacio Pepe. I would go back and try something else for sure.The service was bad and the servers didn't seem to care about anything. Overall, this was s very mediocre dining experience.\",\n",
       " 'I want to like Epistrophy so bad for its cozy vibes. But the service kills it. I\\'ve been three times now, and each time I nearly pulled a muscle trying to wave down the servers! \\xa0And the food doesn\\'t make up for the service. \\xa0Honestly, the place kinda feels like a tourist trap trying really hard to encapsulate the \"real\" Nolita. \\xa0At most, I\\'d return for a quick day drink at the bar...',\n",
       " \"Epistrophy is a lovely Italian restaurant with a great bar program. It was an unseasonably warm day (thanks global warming!) so we were able to take advantage of their sidewalk seating. Great little area for people watching without too much car traffic and noise.Everything in their menu looked amazing that it was hard to choose. So we decided to split a few plates.For starters, the burrata was a no-brainer. I typically don't think burrata needs any accoutrements, but theirs was served with beet carpaccio and toasted almonds, and changed my mind. The sweet and savory really elevated it.We also had the veal/beef meatballs in white wine sauce. It was six to the order, which was the perfect amount for two people. Loved the barebones dish, and dipping bread into the sauce was a highlight.Lastly, we decided to split a pasta dish. It was a pretty lengthy debate since everything sounded amazing, but we landed on the pappardelle in braised beef tomato sauce. It was [chef kissing fingers emoji]. The pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly. Light but still meaty (in both senses of the word).For cocktails, I had the New Fashioned and the 200 Sour since it was a bourbon kinda night. Both were very good.Service was great, and of course the food and atmosphere was amazing. Just the perfect mix of romantic and lively.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ll start with the good- I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Relaxing ambiance, and it\\'s a cozy place to eat, drink, and catch up with friends. It\\'s nice they have circular tables so you can actually see everyone and the conversation isn\\'t just one across the other or side by side. The meh part of it- the actual food.I found the food to be very average and because of that, the prices to be really high for the amount you get and the taste. Here\\'s what we got:Calamari E Funghi- 3/5- not what I was expecting. This calamari wasn\\'t covered in batter or fried (totally missed the \"seared\" part on the menu). It was just the squid mixed with mushrooms on top of what I think was endive. It wasn\\'t bad- it was pretty tasty but this portion was tiny af and also not outstanding in any way ($11)Endive salad- 3/5- also not bad for a salad....but it\\'s a salad. Endive tossed with avocado, orange, croutons, and citrus vinaigrette and seriously something I couldn\\'t make on my own. As I\\'m writing this, part of me feels like they keep the restaurant so dark is so you can\\'t see your plate and how average everything looks on it when it comes out ($13)Gnocchi Al Funghi- 3/5. I mean truffle oil is great but just jacks up the price of a dish that is again, average- homemade potato gnocchi, mixed mushroom, truffle oil, parmigiano-reggiano ($17)Pappardelle Al Sugo Di Carne- 3/5. Flat, fresh pasta, braised beef in tomato sauce, parmigiano-reggiano...you know what I\\'m going to say next. average tasting ($16)The food isn\\'t terrible tasting by any means- everything tasted okay. But that was my biggest qualm with this place- the hefty price tag for portions that are SO SMALL especially for what I felt was very very average food. I\\'d give it a 2.5/5 for the food (if yelp did half stars) with all these factors added in. It\\'s one of those places where you\\'re super excited for the food to come out and when it does and you look at the dish, you\\'re just like oh...that\\'s it?I\\'d come back here for maybe a beer during happy hour and light food at the bar but not again for a full dinner meal. Too much money for only meh food.']"
